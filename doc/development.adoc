== Setting up a development environment on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)

Install development dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-pyscard libykpers-1-1 libu2f-host0 

Setup the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager.git
    $ cd yubikey-manager

Set up a venv (second step differs between platforms, see the https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments[Python docs]):

    $ python3 -m venv .python-venv
    $ source .python-venv/bin/activate

Install in editable mode with pip (from root of repository):

    $ pip install -e .

Run the app:

    $ ykman --version
    $ ykman --help

To update once installed, just make sure the repo is up to date:

    $ git pull

To uninstall, run:

    $ pip uninstall yubikey-manager

=== Code Style

This project uses http://flake8.pycqa.org/[Flake8] for code style with a http://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] hook.
To use these:

    $ pip install pre-commit flake8
    $ pre-commit install

=== Unit tests

To run unit tests:

    $ python setup.py test

=== Integration tests

WARNING: ONLY run these on a dedicated developer key, as it will permanently delete data on the device!

To run integration tests:

   $ INTEGRATION_TESTS=TRUE python setup.py test

== Using vagrant for development

A Vagrantfile with a development environment based on Ubuntu 16.04 is included in the repository.
Modify the Vagrantfile to set up a USB filter to capture the device with VirtualBox.


== Publishing to Ubuntu PPA

 1. Update version number and signoff in `debian/changelog`.
 2. Build and upload package.

For (2) you can use the Vagrant VM in `vagrant/ppa`. You'll need to set up the
VM to capture the YubiKey containing your signing key. If you use VirtualBox,
you can do this by uncommenting the USB filter included in the `Vagrantfile`.
Then:

    alice@work $ cd yubikey-manager/vagrant/ppa
    alice@work $ vagrant up
    alice@work $ vagrant ssh
    ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial $ gpg2 --recv-keys ABCDEF78
    ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial $ gpg2 --card-status
    ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial $ cd yubikey-manager
    ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial $ ~/scripts/make-ppa -k ABCDEF78 -p gpg2
