== Working with the code

=== Install dependencies

It's assumed a Python environment with pip is installed.

==== Windows
Make sure the http://www.swig.org/[swig] executable is in your PATH. Add http://libusb.info/[libusb]
and https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/[ykpers] DLLs to the root of the repository.

==== macOS

    $ brew install swig ykpers libusb

==== Linux (Debian-based distributions)

    $ sudo apt install swig libykpers-1-1 libu2f-udev pcscd libpcsclite-dev

=== Install yubikey-manager from source

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager.git
    $ cd yubikey-manager

Install in editable mode with pip:

    $ pip install -e .

Show available commands:

    $ ykman --help

Show information about inserted YubiKey:

    $ ykman info

Run ykman in DEBUG mode:

    $ ykman --log-level DEBUG info

To uninstall, run:

    $ pip uninstall yubikey-manager

=== Code Style

This project uses http://flake8.pycqa.org/[Flake8] for code style with a http://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] hook.
To use these:

    $ pip install pre-commit flake8
    $ pre-commit install

=== Unit tests

To run unit tests:

    $ tox

=== Integration tests

WARNING: ONLY run these on dedicated developer keys, as it will permanently delete data on the device(s)!

To run integration tests, indicate the serial numbers (given by `ykman list`) of the YubiKeys to test with:

   $ DESTRUCTIVE_TEST_YUBIKEY_SERIALs=123456,234567 tox

The integration test suite will automatically identify which test cases can be run with the
available YubiKeys, and run those test cases for each eligible YubiKey. See
link:integration-tests.adoc[integration-tests.adoc] for a deep dive into how this works.


=== Packaging

For third-party packaging, use the source releases and signatures available https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/Releases/[here].
