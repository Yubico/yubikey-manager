== Working with the code

=== Install dependencies

It's assumed a Python 3 environment with pip is installed.
Additionally, the project uses https://python-poetry.org/[poetry]
as its build tool; install that as well.

==== Windows

Make sure the http://www.swig.org/[swig] executable is in your PATH.

==== macOS

    $ brew install swig

==== Linux (Debian-based distributions)

    $ sudo apt install swig libu2f-udev pcscd libpcsclite-dev

==== Linux (RPM-based distributions)

    # Tested on Fedora 34
    $ sudo dnf install pcsc-lite-devel python3-devel swig

=== Install yubikey-manager from source

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager.git
    $ cd yubikey-manager

Install via poetry:

    $ poetry install

Show available commands:

    $ poetry run ykman --help

Show information about inserted YubiKey:

    $ poetry run ykman info

Run ykman in DEBUG mode:

    $ poetry run ykman --log-level DEBUG info

=== Code Style & Security

This project uses https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Black] and
https://flake8.pycqa.org/[Flake8] for code style,
https://mypy-lang.org[mypy] for static type checking, and
https://github.com/PyCQA[Bandit] for security linting. These are invoked with a
http://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] hook.

To use these:

    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install

=== Unit tests

To run unit tests:

    $ poetry run pytest


=== Integration tests

WARNING: ONLY run these on dedicated developer keys, as it will permanently
delete data on the device(s)!

To run integration tests, indicate the serial number (given by `ykman list`) of
the YubiKey to test with.  Make sure no other YubiKey is connected when running
the test!

   $ poetry run pytest --device 123456

To run the tests over NFC, place the YubiKey to test on an NFC reader, and
indicate both the reader and the serial number of the YubiKey:

   $ poetry run pytest --reader HID --device 123456

The integration test suite will automatically identify which test cases can be
run with the attached YubiKey.


=== Packaging

For third-party packaging, use the source releases and signatures available
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/Releases/[here].
