== Running custom scripts
The ykman executable lets you run custom python scripts in the context of
YubiKey Manager.

WARNING: Never run a script without fully understanding what it does!

Scripts are very powerful, and have the power to harm to both your YubiKey and
your computer.

ONLY run scripts that you fully trust!

See also: link:Library_Usage.adoc[Library Usage].


=== Invoking the script
To run a script, use the `script` subcommand of ykman:

  ykman script myscript.py

You can pass additional arguments used in the script by adding them at the end
of the command:

  ykman script myscript.py 123456 a_word "a string with spaces"

These arguments are accessible in the standard Python way of using sys.argv:

  import sys

  print(sys.argv[1])  # prints "123456"
  print(sys.argv[3])  # prints "a string with spaces"


=== Scripting utilities
We include some functions which may be helpful for scripting purposes in
`ykman/scripting.py`, such as connecting to one or more YubiKeys to perform
actions upon them. See "Writing your first script" below for some example
usage.


=== Adding additional dependencies
By default, the script will run with the full ykman library available, as well
as the Python dependencies used by the application. If your script needs
additional dependencies, you can provide an additional location to load Python
packages from, by using the `--site-dir` argument:

  ykman script --site-dir /path/to/additional/site-packages myscript.py


=== Writing your first script
Create a new file, `myscript.py` and add the following content to it:

[source,py]
----
print("Hello, from ykman!")
----

Now, save the file and run:

  ykman script myscript.py

If everything went as planned, you should see the print output in your
terminal. Something like:

....
> ykman script myscript.py
Hello, from ykman!
>
....

Now for something a bit more interesting. Let's connect to a YubiKey and read
its serial number. Modify the `myscript.py` file to contain the following:

[source,py]
----
from ykman import scripting as s

device = s.single()
print("Found a YubiKey:", device)
----

Save the file, then run it again using `ykman script`, and you should see
output similar to:

....
> ykman script myscript.py
Found a YubiKey: YubiKey 5 NFC (9681624)
>
....

Now, let's pass an argument to our script. We'll modify the script to take a
serial number, and check for the presence of that particular YubiKey. We'll use
the `s.multi` function to keep waiting for more YubiKeys until either the
correct one is found, or the user presses CTRL+C to stop the script. By setting
`allow_initial=True` we allow there to be YubiKeys connected at the start of
the function call. By default, the call will fail if there are YubiKeys already
connected, to prevent accidental programming of the wrong YubiKey.

[source,py]
----
from ykman import scripting as s
import sys

try:
    target_serial = int(sys.argv[1])
except:
    print("Usage: ykman script myscript.py <serial>")
    sys.exit(1)

for device in s.multi(allow_initial=True):
    if device.info.serial == target_serial:
        print("YubiKey found, with serial:", target_serial)
        break
    else:
        print("This is not the YubiKey we are looking for, try again...")
----

Now if we run the script like before, it will fail:

....
> ykman script myscript.py
Usage: ykman script myscript.py <serial>
>
....

This is because the script now expects a serial number. If we try it again,
this time with a serial number, we instead get:

....
> ykman script myscript.py 7800302
This is not the YubiKey we are looking for, try again...
YubiKey found, with serial: 7800302
....

The serial number we passed to the script is stored in `sys.argv`. Since
multiple argument can be passed in, the variable will contain a list, and we
need to tell our script to use the "first" argument, which in our case is the
serial. The first value in `sys.argv` is always the name of the script, so our
argument will be the second value, with index `1`.  Arguments passed to the
script are always of type `string`, so we need to interpret it as a number, and
`int`. Now, we use `s.multi` to watch for connected YubiKeys. Each one is
checked against the given serial number, and the script will stop when either
the correct YubiKey is found, or if the user presses `Ctrl+C` to stop the
`s.multi` call.

Congratulations! You've written your first script that interacts with a
YubiKey. There's a lot more that's possible. See the section on
link:Library_Usage.adoc[Library Usage] for more advanced usage.
