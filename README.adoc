In order for the pip package to work, https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/[ykpers] and http://libusb.info/[libusb] need to be installed on your system as well.
https://pyscard.sourceforge.io/[Pyscard] is also needed in some form, and if it's not installed pip builds it using http://www.swig.org/[swig] and potentially https://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/pcsclite.html[PCSC lite].
