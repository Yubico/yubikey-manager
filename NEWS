* Version 0.6.1 (unreleased)
 ** PIV: The methods `PivController.sign` now accepts an optional `pin` argument, defaulting to `None`. If a `pin` argument is given, `sign` will recursively attempt to verify the PIN and retry the signing operation if it fails with the `6a82` (Access denied) status.
 ** PIV: The following methods of `PivController` now accept an optional `pin` argument, defaulting to `None`, which is forwarded to the `sign` method:
  *** `generate_certificate_signing_request`
  *** `generate_self_signed_certificate`
  *** `sign_cert_builder`
  *** `sign_csr_builder`

* Version 0.6.0 (released 2018-02-09)
 ** OpenPGP: Expose remaining PIN retries in info command and API.

 ** API breaking changes:
  *** OATH: New API more similar to yubioath-android
 ** CLI breaking changes:
  *** OATH: Touch prompt now written to stderr instead of stdout
  *** OATH: `-a|--algorithm` option to `list` command removed
  *** OATH: Columns in `code` command are now dymanically spaced depending on contents
  *** OATH: `delete` command now requires confirmation or `-f|--force` argument
  *** OATH: IDs printed by `list` command now include TOTP period if not 30
  *** Changed outputs:
   **** INFO: "Device name" output changed to "Device type"
   **** PIV: "Management key is stored on device" output changed to "Management key is stored on the YubiKey"
   **** PIV: "All PIV data have been cleared from the device" output changed to "All PIV data have been cleared from your YubiKey"
   **** PIV: "The current management key is stored on the device" prompt changed to "The current management key is stored on the YubiKey"
   **** SLOT: "blank to use device serial" prompt changed to "blank to use YubiKey serial number"
   **** SLOT: "Using device serial" output changed to "Using YubiKey device serial"
   **** Lots of failure case outputs changed
 ** New features:
  *** Support for multiple devices via new top-level option `-d|--device`
  *** New top-level option `-l|--log-level` to enable logging
  *** OATH: Support for remembering passwords locally.
  *** OATH: New option `-s|--single` for `code` command
  *** PIV: `set-pin-retries` command now warns that PIN and PUK will be reset to factory defaults, and prints those defaults after resetting
 ** API bug fixes:
  *** OATH: `valid_from` and `valid_to` for `Code` are now absolute instead of relative to the credential period
  *** OATH: `period` for non-TOTP `Code` is now `None`
