"""
This script will program Yubico OTP credentials for a batch of YubiKeys, outputting
a .csv file with the secret values for upload to a validation server.

YubiKeys are inserted as the script is running, and can be removed once programmed.
When done, press Ctrl+C to end the batch. If a YubiKey is inserted twice in the same
session it will be ignored.

Usage: yubiotp_batch.py <output_file>
