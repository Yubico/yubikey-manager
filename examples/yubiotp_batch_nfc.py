"""
This script will program Yubico OTP credentials for a batch of YubiKeys, outputting
a .csv file with the secret values for upload to a validation server.

YubiKeys are programmed over NFC using an NFC reader. One YubiKey can be placed
on the reader at a time. When done, press Ctrl+C to end the batch. If a YubiKey
is presented twice in the same session it will be ignored.

Usage: yubiotp_batch_nfc.py <nfc_reader> <output_file>
